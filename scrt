I posted two polls on twitter.  Each poll gave some information about the probability of some event in a hypothetical group A and asked participants to determine what the probability was in some other group B based on a comparison with group A.

Polls differed in how that comparison was made. On the left hand side are results from the poll where I made the comparison in temrs of probability, on the right hand side are results from the poll in which I made the comparison in terms of odds.

When I made the comparison in terms of probability, pariticpants knew the answer -- here highlighted in blue -- immediately.  However, when I made the comparison in terms of odds, things changed.  The correct answer was not selected the majority of the time, and in fact there is a lot of uncertainty in participats as to what the right answer should be.  

Some participants are maybe treating odds as probability, which might be fine coloquailly but actually leads to the wrong answer.  Others seem to know odds is not the same as probability, but are unsure how odds works and if the answer should be less than 20% or greater than 20%.

Now, you might say "Demetri, these results are from a collection of people who self select into following you on twitter.  These aren't accurate" -- and I think that's a good point.
